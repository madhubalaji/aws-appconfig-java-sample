## Migration Notes
1. All javax namespace dependencies have been updated to their jakarta equivalents as required for Jakarta EE 9+
2. Wrapper class constructors have been replaced with valueOf() methods as they are deprecated in Java 9+
3. Spring Boot 3.x requires Jakarta EE 9+ APIs, which have been properly updated
4. Test framework has been modernized to JUnit Jupiter for better Java 17 support
5. Build configuration has been updated to properly support Java 17 features

The application should now be fully compatible with Java 17 and follow current best practices.
